# Password Strength Evaluation

## 1. Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.
## 2. Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.

abcd  
password123  
Santhiya2025  
S@nth!y@_C0d3  

## 3. Test each password on password strength checker.

abcd            -   0%     -   Very Weak  
password123     -   43%    -   Good  
Santhiya2025    -   91%    -   Very Strong  
S@nth!y@_C0d3   -   100%   -   Very Strong  

## 5. Identify best practices for creating strong passwords

- Use at least 12 characters.  
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols.  
- Avoid using dictionary words, names, or dates.  
- Avoid using common words like password.  
- Use passphrases with random unrelated words (e.g Door*Horse_Mug)  

## 6. Write down tips learned from the evaluation.

- Longer passwords = stronger security.  
- Random combinations are harder to crack.  
- Personal informaton like name,Date of Birth makes passwords weaker.  
- Common substitutions for a replaced by @ are good.  
- Best to combine randomness with length.  

## 7. Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary)

**Brute Force**           Tries all possible combinations until it finds the right one.  
**Dictionary Attack**     Tries common words and phrases from a pre-built list.  
**Phishing**              Tricks user into giving password  
**Credential Stuffing**   Uses leaked username-password pairs from previous breaches.  

## 8. Summarize how password complexity affects security.

- Weak passwords like 123456,abcd can be cracked in seconds with brute-force.  
- Passwords with high randomness and length can take centuries to crack.  
- Adding just one more character can significantly increase crack time.  
- Passwords with predictable patterns like Name@123 are easier to guess.
